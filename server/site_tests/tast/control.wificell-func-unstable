Run the unstable Tast tests which verify basic WiFi functions using wificell fixture.

"group:wificell" indicates the test runs on wificell.
And its sub-attributes "wificell_func" and "wificell_unstable" indicates the
test is used to verify basic WiFi functionality and is unstable or yet to be
verified.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
